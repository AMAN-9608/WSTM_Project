# Book Rating Prediction using Recommender Systems
## Project Description
<p align="justify">
The goal of the project is to build a recommender system for books. For this exercise, we have used the dataset containing books related to the genre “Poetry” from Goodreads, which is a website that allows users to freely search their database for books and book reviews. Through this project, we have implemented a recommendation
system, for recommending poetry books using multiple approaches based on collaborative filtering and other models leveraging deep learning methods. We shall cover three implementations, item-item collaborative filtering, neural collaborative filtering as well as wide-and-deep model for recommender systems 
The dataset used for this project comes from the book cataloging website Goodreads, and it has data on over 36K books and 377K users.
